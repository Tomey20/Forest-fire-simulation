# Forest-fire-simulation
Code for the forest fire simulation.

You run the forest fire simulation by running the graph_forest.py script in the Zip-file. Make sure that you have at the very least numpy, networkx, matplotlib and scipy installed in order to run the simulation. The prompts for the simulation will appear in the terminal.
